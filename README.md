# BulkOpenAIDashboardDeleter
* OpenAI doesn't provide an option to delete all the assistants, files and vector stores in bulk in their UI in the dashboard. This LINQPad script/app deletes them in bulk.
* The code can be easily converted to a C# console app or other languages
* LINQPad can can be downloaded and used for free from <a href="BulkDeleteOpenAI.linq" target="_blank">Linqpad.net</a>
* Open the BulkDeleteOpenAI.linq in LINQPad, paste in your OpenAI api key and run it.
